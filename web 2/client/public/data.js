        info:'Actinic keratoses (also called solar keratoses) are dry scaly patches of skin that have been damaged by the sun. <br/> The patches are not usually serious. But there\'s a small chance they could become skin cancer, so it\'s important to avoid further damage to your skin.',
        symptoms:[
            'Rough, dry or scaly patch of skin, usually less than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter',
            'Flat to slightly raised patch or bump on the top layer of skin',
            'In some cases, a hard, wartlike surface',
            'Color variations, including pink, red or brown',
            'Itching, burning, bleeding or crusting',
            'New patches or bumps on sun-exposed areas of the head, neck, hands and forearms'

    'Melanocytic nevi(nv)':{
        info:'Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms or hamartomas composed of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that constitutively colonize the epidermis. Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest and migrate during embryogenesis to selected ectodermal sites (primarily the skin and the CNS), but also to the eyes and the ears. Ectopic melanocytes have been identified at autopsy in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Congenital melanocytic nevi are thought to represent an anomaly in embryogenesis and, as such, could be considered, at least in a sense, malformations or hamartomas.',
        symptoms:[
            'There are usually no symptoms with congenital melanocytic nevi.  Sometimes the larger ones may itch.',
            'If pain, severe or persistent itching, bleeding, or crusting develop, see your child’s doctor.'

        info:'Melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin — the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.',
        symptoms:[
            'Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face',
           'Asymmetry. The shape of one-half of the mole does not match the other.',
            'Border. The edges are ragged, notched, uneven, or blurred.',
            'Color. Shades of black, brown, and tan may be present. Areas of white, gray, red, or blue may also be seen.',
            'Diameter. The diameter is usually larger than 6 millimeters (mm) or has grown in size. This is about 1/4 inch in diameter, about the size of a pencil eraser. Melanoma may be smaller when it is first detected.'

            'Appearance: A dermatofibroma presents as a round bump that is mostly under the skin.',
            'Size: The normal range is about 0.5–1.5 centimeters (cm), with most lesions being 0.7–1.0 cm in diameter. The size will usually remain stable.',
